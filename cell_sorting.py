"""Summarise cell counts from a roimanager hdf5 file.

After counting cells with roimanager and creating a hdf5 file, this
module can be used to read the file and sort cells into ROIs.

Each hdf5 file created with roimanager has the paths of the ROIs
identified and the coordinates of each cell in a brain section. The
class RoiFile in this module load such a hdf5 file and allows to
extract the number of cells per region (ROI), put it all together into
one data frame, and save the data.

Example
-------

>>> fname = "demodata/20-0224.hdf5"
>>> f = RoiFile(fname)
>>> f.get_markers_per_structure()
ACB    1
ORB    2
PIR    1

    """Encapsulates a hdf5 file created with roimanager.

    A hdf5 file from roimanager contains information from one brain
    section about cell counts, their location, and ROIs created. The
    file has two groups: 'markers' and 'roiset'.

    'roiset' group has one subgroup for each ROI found in that
    brain section. The name of the dataset is the acronym for the
    brain region, and it willhave a dataset 'xy' which is are the
    vertices of the ROI.

    'markers' is a group with 3 datasets, each row corresponds to a
    marker (i.e. a cell) in the brain section:
        'c'    [string] colour name of the marker.
        'm'    [string] mpl marker character.
        'xy'   [integer] x, y coordinates of the marker.

    attributes of '/' include image size, resolution, name, atlas_ref.
