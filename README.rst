Facilitates delimiting and naming regions of interest (ROIs) and
counting cells in micrographs from brain tissue.

This package displays an imageJ tiff image and provides tools to
navigate the image, draw and name ROIs, and mark cells. The ROIs and
markers are saved into individual hdf5 files for future analyses.

The package was originally developed to count projections neurones in
sections of mouse brain, and sort those cells into anatomical regions;
